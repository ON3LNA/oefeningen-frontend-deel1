# Site Specification

## Objective

Create a `sitespec.html` file explaining the contents of your website. Will it be about a specific business, a certain person, or organization?

Provide details about your site:
- Client or subject
- Title
- Purpose
- Target audience
- Content of the website

## Description

- Describe the business/person/organization in about 5 sentences.
- What is the topic? What aspects do you want to highlight? From which perspective? Describe this in about 5 sentences.
- Is there an existing website? If there is, provide additional information (URL, reasons for redesigning the current site).
- Who is the target audience? For whom are you creating the site?
- What are the goals of the site? What is it trying to achieve?
- Which pages will you create? Provide the content for each page. Look at websites on similar topics for inspiration (what do you like/dislike about them and why). Keep in mind that one of the pages should include a (non-functional) form. You can determine the purpose of this form yourself.
- Are there any other details you can share about the site at this stage?
- You can use [this screenshot](sitespecTemplate.png) as a template. Write the necessary HTML code yourself. Pay attention to the correct document structure.

## How to Submit

- Push your code to GitHub. 
- Create a release "sitespec".
- The URL should be as https://github.../sitespec.html
Later on, this site specification will be the fifth page of your website.

## Deadline

The site specification is considered as exercise on lesson 1. 

## Self Assessment
