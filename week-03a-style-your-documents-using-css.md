# Style your documents using CSS

## Description

In the  exercise ["Create the Homepage"](https://github.com/UCLL-Frontend/oefeningen-frontend-deel1/blob/main/week-02-create-the-homepage-of-your-static-website.md), you created your first HTML document (homepage). The goal of this exercise is now to style that page using CSS, working for a small screen (width 400 pixels). In the next lessons, you will learn how to move blocks around so that you make the best use of wide screen space.

During the course, you learned about external CSS files, embedded CSS, inline CSS, selectorsâ€¦ Time to turn this into practice. Open your homepage and resize the browser screen.

## Specifics

- Start by reviewing the HTML document created in the previous exercise. Understand its structure, elements, and content.
- Create in your project directory a folder "CSS". Create a new external CSS file with a .css extension in that directory. You can name it something like styles.css. This file will contain the styles for your HTML document.
- In the HTML document's `<head>` section, link to the external CSS file using the `<link>` element.
- In your external CSS file (styles.css), apply styles to various elements of the HTML document. We give some suggestions:
  - Play with colors (background-color, color of text):
    - Change color of all text to #333.
    - Create colorset for "dark mode" (dark background-color and text in color with a lot of contrast).
    - Give footer and header contrasting background-color.
  - Choose a nice font-family. Do not hesitate to choose a different one for headings and normal text.
    - Change font-family from serif to non-serif.
    - Try some [Web Safe Fonts](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-safe-html-css-fonts).
  - Resize text for one part of the page to 1.2em and the other part to 0.8em. Choose an appropriate line-height.
  - Play with selectors:
    - Give the links in the navigation a different color than the links elsewhere in the text.
    - Show the first list-item in another color than the other list-items.
    - Give the headers a font-family different from the rest of the text.
- In the `<head>` of your HTML document, you can also include embedded CSS using the `<style>` element to apply specific styles to elements within that document.
- Practice inline style by using styles directly on individual HTML elements using the style attribute.
- Open your HTML document in a web browser and test the styles. Resize the browser window to see how the responsive styles for small screens work.
- Feel free to experiment with different styles, colors, and layouts to achieve the desired look and feel for your HTML document. 
- It's good practice to add comments in your CSS code to explain the purpose of different style rules and provide context for your styling decisions.
- Check the colour contrast with [Colour Contrast Analyzer](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/).
- Test using [HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu/) if each HTML page is valid according to the current web standard HTML5.
- Test using [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) if your CSS file is valid according to the web standard CSS3.
