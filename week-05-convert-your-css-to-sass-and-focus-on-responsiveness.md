# Convert your CSS to Sass and focus on responsiveness

## Description

You learned the advantages of using the Sass preprocessor in class. It's now time to convert your current CSS code to SCSS. Next to that, you will have to optimize your index page and at least one other page for mobile devices.

## Specifics

- Start by reviewing the existing CSS stylesheet that you want to convert to Sass. Make sure you understand the current styling and layout of the web page.
- Install Sass on your current project.
- Put all SCSS files in the folder "CSS". Your lecturer will check your .scss-files, so make sure they can find it in that folder.
- Organize Styles with Sass Features:
  - Define variables for commonly used values such as colors, fonts, and breakpoints.
  - Use nesting to group related styles together.
  - Use partials/components.
  - Use Sass's media query features to define styles for different screen sizes.
  - Use the Sass compiler to convert your .scss file to a regular CSS file.
  - Replace the link to your old CSS file in your HTML document with the link to the newly compiled CSS file (styles.css).
- Test your web page on different screen sizes and devices to ensure that it responds well. Make adjustments to your Sass code and media queries as needed to achieve the desired responsiveness.
- Make comments in your Sass file to explain the purpose of different sections and styles, especially if the codebase is shared with others.

## How to Submit

Deliver the assignment on the webserver. It must be available on the class list under the title "site." The URL should be as [https://r0934094.webontwerp.ucll.be/site](https://r0934094.webontwerp.ucll.be/site).

## Deadline

This exercise is considered as exercise on the lessons of CSS: SASS, CRAP, and Typography. You must deliver it as part of "Opdracht HTML en CSS," with a deadline of 15/11/23.

## Self Assessment

Check your submission yourself:

- The (generated) CSS code is valid (check on [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)).
- The HTML is valid (check all pages on https://html5.validator.nu/ or https://validator.w3.org/).
- All CSS files, incl .scss-files, are in the folder "CSS".
- SCSS is built with components that have a logical structure.
- The associated CSS is in partials or subfiles (e.g., _header.scss) that are organized into folders (directories).
- You use nesting.
- You use variables.
