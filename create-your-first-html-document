# Create your first HTML document

## Description

In the site specification, you described your subject, your target audience, and the purpose of the website. You thought about the structure of the site and the specific content for each page.

The next step is to translate one of those pages into valid HTML5. In this assignment, you need to do this for the homepage (`index.html`).

## Specifics

- Create a valid HTML5 page called `index.html` using the correct structure (header/main/footer/section/article).
- Include navigation with links to pages that do not yet exist.
- Pick final file names and set specific titles using the correct tags.
- You can add a logo (image) if you already have one available.
- For other images, use placeholders (for example: [https://placehold.co/](https://placehold.co/)).
- Add 'Lorem Ipsum' paragraphs to simulate textual content. (In VS Code you can type `lorem` in your `index.html` file to automatically add lorem copy using the Emmet notation.) [Emmet Cheat Sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)
- Test if each HTML page is valid according to the current web standard HTML5 using [https://html5.validator.nu/](https://html5.validator.nu/).
