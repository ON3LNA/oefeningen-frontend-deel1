# Create the Homepage of Your Static Website

## Description

In the site specification, you described your subject, your target audience, and the purpose of the website. You thought about the structure of the site and the specific content for each page.
The next step is to translate one of those pages into valid HTML5. In this assignment, you need to do this for the homepage (`index.html`).

## Specifics

- Start by creating a new HTML file and naming it `index.html`. This will be your homepage.
- Use the correct HTML5 document structure, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
- Include a header section containing the website title and possibly a logo if available.
- Add a navigation section with links to other pages, even if those pages do not exist yet. Use placeholder URLs for now.
- Add a working link to your site specification.
- In the `<body>` section, add the main content of your homepage within a `<main>` element. You can use placeholder content (Lorem Ipsum) for now. (In VS Code, you can type `lorem` in your `index.html` file to automatically add lorem copy using the Emmet notation.) [Emmet Cheat Sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)
- Images:
  - Add a logo or other images when available.
  - For other images, use placeholders (for example: [https://placehold.co/](https://placehold.co/)).
- Include a footer section with copyright information or any other relevant details.
- Test the validity of your HTML using an online validator, such as [https://html5.validator.nu/](https://html5.validator.nu/). Ensure that there are no errors or warnings in the validation reports.

## How to Submit

Deliver the assignment on the webserver. It must be available on the class list under the title “site”. The URL should be as [https://r0934094.webontwerp.ucll.be/site](https://r0934094.webontwerp.ucll.be/site).

## Deadline

This exercise is considered as exercise on lesson 1. You must deliver it as part of “Tussentijdse opdracht” with the deadline 12/10.

## Self Assessment

Check your submission yourself:
- The page is online and is accessible through the appropriate link
- The navigation has a link to your site specification.
- The HTML is valid (check on [https://html5.validator.nu/](https://html5.validator.nu/) or [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/))
- The document structure is correct: you use the HTML elements header/main/footer, headings (h1, h2, …), paragraphs (p), article/section, nav (with ul and li as child), …
- Each sectioning element has a heading
- Headings have a correct hierarchy (e.g. no missing levels)
- You use the following HTML elements at least once: p, ul or ol or dl, figure with figcaption and img, strong or em, a (for link inside the page, link to a page in your project and external link).
- Paragraphs are separated by the element `<p>` (not by putting breaks `<br>` between text blocks).
- Images are put together in a directory.
- File names start with a lowercase letter, do not contain a space or special characters.

Note: Your final index page may not have a meaningful application for all the requested HTML elements. In that case, make sure you use them at least once on another page so that you demonstrate your understanding of the course content.

Feel free to create the other pages in your own tempo. In week 3 you will need a page with some photos and/or content blocks, keep that in mind.
