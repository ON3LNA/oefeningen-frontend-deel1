# Assignment Module 1

## Objective

To complete the first module of the OPO, you will deliver a limited static site.

## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to create your own (small) static website. You are free to choose the subject: a hobby of yours or someone else's, a business, a club, your vacation resort ... You must compose the necessary (meaningful) content yourself.

Make sure you can demonstrate your knowledge of HTML/CSS well with the chosen topic.

If you have no inspiration, you may use content from the website [https://www.visitleuven.be](https://www.visitleuven.be). We contacted the owners and have permission for you to use the content (respectfully), both text and images. You are not supposed to redesign this website or copy the layout or content without question. Use the content to share your vision of the city (why do you think Leuven is special? What places do you like in Leuven?). You can also create a promo site for a special target group, for example people who like sports.

We will help you build the site. With each piece of theory, you'll be instructed to apply those learnings to your own website. This way, your project takes shape week by week.

## Requirements

- You may choose the same topic with different people, but everyone will make their own version of the site
- Minimum of five pages. The fifth page must show the site specification [https://github.com/UCLL-Frontend/oefeningen-frontend-deel1/blob/main/site-specification.md].
- Must include a form where the 'submit' button will not work (that's back-end). The form must have a checkbox or radio button and at least 3 different input types (checkbox/radio button not included).
- Sufficient content (so no pages with 3 sentences of text on them): sufficient texts, pictures, ... It is the intention that you show that you have mastered all the material of the first part of the OPO (HTML/CSS). You cannot do that with a site consisting of twenty sentences and three pictures.
- Modern CSS (i.e. flex, grid, ... and no float, inline-block). Please don’t repeat yourself (DRY) and provide comments.
- We would also like to see the SCSS version of your CSS, so you also put the SCSS files on the server in the same folder as your CSS file(s). If we can't find your SCSS files there, we won't improve them.
- The work you submit must show that you have mastered all aspects covered in module 1 of the OPO.
- The site will only be evaluated on our server at the appropriate [link](https://webontwerp.ucll.be/Ti-Front-end/reeksen/reeksoverzicht.html). Study the "site" link after your name on [the class list](https://webontwerp.ucll.be/Ti-Front-end/reeksen/reeksoverzicht.html) (first item under "Opdrachten en Toetsen”) and make sure your site opens when you click on that link. If your site is not in the correct location or loaded late you will receive score 0 on the entire assignment.
- HTML and CSS validated. One CSS file for the entire site (possibly separate reset.css is possible but not necessary). You also use both languages for their intended purpose: HTML adds structure and meaning (so not too many "div"), CSS layout and design.
- You do not use frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, ...).
- Taking inspiration from other sites is possible if the source is mentioned in the (CSS) code. Literally copying large pieces is against copyright law, so you don't do that because that is fraud.
- Your site is responsive, works on all browsers / operating systems / devices / screen sizes
- Visually pleasing, good typography, CRAP
- Accessible for everyone
- Performant: loads quickly, images not larger than necessary (so no 50 Mpixel images of 5 MB large)

## How to Submit

1. By the expiration of the deadline (Sunday evening, Nov. 13), your assignment must be online on the school web server as described above.
2. Submit the Toledo Assignment. In the text field, add two screenshots:
   - One showing that your CSS is valid
   - One that shows that the page with form is HTML5 valid
