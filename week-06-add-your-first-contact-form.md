# Add your first contact form

## Description

In this assignment, you will add a contact form to one of your web pages.

## Specifics

- Create the form itself using the `<form>` element. This is where you define the inputs and other form elements.
- Add the form fields inside the `<form>` element using various input elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>`.
- Use the `<label>` element to provide labels for form fields and connect them to the respective input elements using the `for` attribute and `id` attribute.
- Add validation attributes such as `type`, `required`, `pattern`, or `min/max` to ensure data integrity, completeness, and accessibility.
- Apply CSS styles to make the form visually appealing and user-friendly. You can either include CSS directly in the HTML file using `<style>` tags or link to an external CSS file.
- Test the form in different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility and functionality. Some things you should check:
  - The use of the available space in the browser window: full width for small devices, limited width for a larger window.
  - The placement of the submit-button.
  - The size and position of the input text.
  - The placement of the input labels.
- Test the validity of your HTML using an online validator, such as [https://html5.validator.nu/](https://html5.validator.nu/). Ensure that there are no errors or warnings in the validation reports.
- Designing a form properly requires a lot of knowledge of CSS. So use this form to convince your lecturer of your knowledge. You can do this by using enough different types of input elements, e.g. checkbox, radio button, text-area (so not only `<input>`).

## How to Submit

Deliver the assignment on the webserver. It must be available on the class list under the title “site”. The URL should be as [https://r0934094.webontwerp.ucll.be/site](https://r0934094.webontwerp.ucll.be/site).

## Deadline

This exercise is considered as exercise on the lessons of HTML/CSS: forms. You must deliver it as part of “Opdracht HTML en CSS,” with a deadline of 15/11/23.

## Self Assessment

Check your submission yourself:

- The HTML is valid (check on [https://html5.validator.nu/](https://html5.validator.nu/) or [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)).
- The (generated) CSS code is valid (check on [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)).
- Your form is meaningful and relevant to the target audience, taking into account aspects of "usability."
- It has sufficient complexity: at least 3 different input types, in addition to "submit" type.
- It has custom layout (via scss) with special attention to 'mobile' display.
- It has good horizontal and vertical alignment.
- There is client-side validation.
- You use correct input types.
- The form is accessible, see WAI Tutorial - forms, and also:
  - Labels and form fields are connected.
  - Required fields are announced within the label, and the `required` attribute is used.
